					<h5>Arts-Related Majors</h5>
					<p align="left">The academic major is considered a defining and dominant characteristic of the
						undergraduate degree. "The ascendancy of the disciplines in the late nineteenth century and
						their continuing dominance throughout the twentieth century have left an indelible imprint on
						the shape and direction of the academic major" and research affirms that the academic major is
						the strongest and clearest curricular link to gains in student learning.</p>
					<h5>Science and Math-Related Majors</h5>
					<p align="left">Over the last 30 years, the sciences have exploded into an extravagant array of
						possibilities. Some, such as bioengineering, can be very competitive to get into. Most of these
						have stringent GPA and prerequisite coursework requirements. Pre-med students typically choose a
						major from this list, although statistically, music students stand a better chance of acceptance
						at med school.â€‹</p>
					<h5>Engineering and Technology Majors</h5>
					<p align="left">These are all highly competitive majors. Virtually every major on this list, except
						applied mathematical science, is impacted</p>
					<h5>Literature, Language, and Social Science Majors</h5>
					<p align="left">Just as most premed (pre-dent and pre-pharm) students choose from the sciences list,
						pre-law students tend to select majors from this list. Asterisks denote more competitive majors.
