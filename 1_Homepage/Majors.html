					<h1>Majors</h1>
					<p align="left">An academic major is the academic discipline to which an undergraduate student
						formally commits. A student who successfully completes all courses required for the major
						qualifies for a graduate degree. The word major is also sometimes used administratively to refer
						to the academic discipline pursued by a graduate student or postgraduate student in a master's
						or doctoral program.
						An academic major typically requires completion of a combination of prescribed and elective
						courses in the chosen discipline. In addition, most colleges and universities require that all
						students take a general core curriculum in the liberal arts. The latitude a student has in
						choosing courses varies from program to program. An academic major is administered by select
						faculty in an academic department. A major administered by more than one academic department is
						called an interdisciplinary major. In some settings, students may be permitted to design their
						own major, subject to faculty approval. In the US, students are usually not required to choose
						their major discipline when first enrolling as an undergraduate. Normally students are required
						to commit by the end of their second academic year at latest, and some schools even disallow
						students from declaring a major until this time. A student who declares two academic majors is
						said to have a double major. A coordinate major is an ancillary major designed to complement the
						primary one. A coordinate major requires fewer course credits to complete.
					</p>
					<p align="left">The academic major is considered a defining and dominant characteristic of the
						undergraduate degree. "The ascendancy of the disciplines in the late nineteenth century and
						their continuing dominance throughout the twentieth century have left an indelible imprint on
						the shape and direction of the academic major" and research affirms that the academic major is
						the strongest and clearest curricular link to gains in student learning. While general education
						is considered to be the breadth component of an undergraduate education, the major is commonly
						deemed as the depth aspect.</p>
